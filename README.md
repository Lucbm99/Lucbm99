My name is Lucas Baradel Marchiori and I'm an adventurous person who has a special taste for technology. Currently, I study the course of Systems Analysis and Development and work with frontend development, such as screen prototyping and responsive design and a bit of backend also for sites and systems.
As the technologies improve over time, I do my best to be always updated to the main market requirements.
